# Fix Auth Flow Instructions

The login is working but the redirect isn't happening properly. Here's what to do:

## 1. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 2. Test Login Flow
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Login with:
   - Email: `alice@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. After clicking login, you should see "Welcome back!" message
4. You should be redirected to `/dashboard` automatically

## 3. If Still Not Working

The issue might be that Supabase cookies aren't being set properly. Try this:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab â†’ Cookies**
3. After logging in, check if you see cookies starting with `sb-qtzcerfovpoyjykqfrnt-auth-token`
4. If no cookies are present, the issue is with cookie setting

## 4. Manual Test
If redirect doesn't work automatically:
1. After seeing "Welcome back!" message
2. Manually go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. You should be able to access the dashboard

## 5. Troubleshooting
If dashboard shows "Not authenticated":
1. Check browser console for errors
2. The middleware might not be recognizing the auth state
3. Try refreshing the page after login

The auth system is working (login succeeds), it's just the redirect/auth state propagation that needs fixing.
