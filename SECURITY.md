## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT open a public issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately

Send your vulnerability report to the project maintainer via:
- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Email with "SECURITY" in the subject line

### 3. Include details

Please include as much information as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response timeline

- **24 hours**: Acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and impact evaluation
- **7 days**: Status update and planned response
- **30 days**: Resolution or detailed explanation if longer needed

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation on all user inputs
- **File Upload**: Size and type restrictions with secure file handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Environment Security**: Secure environment variable management

### Known Limitations (Phase 0)

- **Local Storage**: Files stored locally (not recommended for production)
- **Mock Payments**: No real payment processing (development only)
- **SQLite Database**: Not recommended for production scale

### Production Recommendations

For production deployment, consider:
- PostgreSQL database with proper access controls
- Cloud storage with CDN
- Real payment processing (Stripe) with PCI compliance
- Enhanced rate limiting and monitoring
- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular security audits

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web application security
5. **Keep dependencies updated** with security patches

### For Deployers

1. **Use strong JWT secrets** (minimum 32 characters)
2. **Enable HTTPS** for all traffic
3. **Set up proper CORS** policies
4. **Use secure headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
5. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
6. **Regular backups** with encryption
7. **Limit database access** to necessary services only

## Vulnerability Disclosure

After a vulnerability is fixed:
1. We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter
2. Credit will be given to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)
3. A security advisory will be published
4. Users will be notified of the need to update

## Security Contact

For security-related questions that are not vulnerabilities:
- Open a GitHub issue with the "security" label
- Check our documentation for security guidelines
